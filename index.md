I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton and I hopefully plan on becoming a software developer with a hobby of creating video games. 

## Favorite Labs 

Lab 1 
This was the project that started them all. I learned the basics of utilizing git and the terminal. With this introduction, I was able to dip my feet into the world of coding. 

Lab 9
This lab was a challenge. It was the first lab where I couldn't rely on outside help in order to get this project done. I had to bite the bullet and in doing so I learned how satisfying coding can be when you finally figure out the piece to the puzzle. 

Lab 12
This project was the last lab we for 120L. This one wasn't as challenging as the rest nor was it as interesting. However, it's the most memorable because I'm able to see how far I was able to come. It taught me that time and effort really does pay off.
